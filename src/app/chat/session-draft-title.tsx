 * The tab of a session that has never been sent renders this instead of its

 * stash republishes it. Re-registering the contribution at that rate would
 * re-render the whole panes area, so the label subscribes for itself and its
 * own key only.
 *
 * Falls back to the placeholder rather than going blank, so an emptied composer
 * reads the same as one never typed into. The placeholder comes from `useI18n`
 * and not from `newSessionTitle()`, so a language switch renames the tab on the
 * spot instead of on the next start.
